# 1. Organizations and people

- Covers:
    - Roles and responsibilities
    - Formal organizational structure
    - Culture
    - Staffing and competencies
- An organization should ensure that its structure and management is well-defined and supports its overall strategy and operation model
- Leader: advocates values that help and motivate people to work in desirable ways
    - createes shared values and attitutes
    - promotes a culture of trust and transparency
    - facilitates communication

## People

People are key in this dimension
- management and leadership styles
- communication and collaboration
- update skills and competencices
- interface between specialization and roles
- levels of collaboration and coordination
- broad knowledge and deep specialization


# 2. Information and Technology

applies supporting both to service management and it services
- examples service management
    - workslow manadgement
    - analytical tools
    - artificial intelligence
- examples it services
    - applications
    - databases
    - artificial intelligence (again)
    - it architecture

when applied to the SVS, this dimension includes:
- information and knowledge
- technologies
- relationships between them

> Information management is the primary means of delivering customer level

Information criteria
- availability
- reliability
- accessibility
- timeliness
- accuracy
- relevance

> Organizations must consider how information is exchanged between different services and service components. Ex: **LGPD, GDPR**

> Other industries may have regulations that impose constraints on the collection and managemend of data.

## Selecting the Right Technology
- is it compatible to the current architecture?
- does it raise any regulatory, compliance, security control issues?
- will it continue to be valueable? 
- does it align wieh the strategy?
- does the org have the skills to support and maintain?
- does it have sufficient automation to be developed, deployed, operated?
- 
- does it introduce new risks or constraints?

## Factors influencing technology
- Culture
    - some organizations are more interseted in being technologically
    - other focus on traditional way of working
- Nature of the business
    - a company with government clients may have restrictions on the use of some techonologies
    - finance industries cannot use open souce and public services

# 3. Partners and suppliers

> Every organization and service depends on services provided by other organizations to some extent

This dimension encompasses an organization's relationships with other organizations

**Service integration and management**: method to address partners and supliers

## Relationships between organizations
- goods supply
    - outputs: goods supplied
    - responsibility for outputs: supplier
    - responsibility for achievement of the outcomes: customer
    - level of formality: formal supply contract/invoices
    - risks not shared
    - easy to replace supplier
- service delivery:
    - outputs: services delivered
    - responsibility for outputs: provider
    - responsibility for achievement of the outcomes: customer
    - level of formality: formal agreements and flexible cases
- service partnership:
    - outputs: value co-created
    - responsibility for outputs: shared between proivider and customer
    - responsibility for achievement of the outcomes: shared between proivider and customer
    - level of formality: shared goals, generic agrreements, flexible case-based arrangements

## Organization Strategy

> an organization's strategy for choosing partners and suppliers should be based on its goals, culture, and business environment

Factors:
- strategic focus: some prefer to focus on core, other prefer to develop by its own
- corporate culture
- resource scarcity: some resources may be difficult to find
- cost concerns
- subject matter expertise: may be less risky to hire some supplier than developt itself
- external constraints: political/legal/etc
- demand patterns: example: seasonal needs of customers

## Cloud computing

ITSM is focusing on value for customers (and is technology-agostic)

> what matters is not the technology, but the oppportunities it creates for the customers

Key factors:
- on-demand availability
- network access
- resource pooling
- rapid elasticity
- measured service

# 4. Value Streams and processes

They define the activities, workflows, controls, and procedures to achieve 
the agreed objectives.
How the parts of organization work in integrated and coordinated way to enable value creation.

## Value stream
> series of steps an organization undertakes to create and deliver products and servies to consumers. Combines the organization's value chain activities

### Steps
- some are value-adding activities
- soma are non value-adding activities (waste)

### Benefits:
- clear picture of what activities delivers
- map work identifieed by value stream map (can check non-value adding)
- can find opportunities to increase value-adding
- includes procces automation (or more efficience technology)
- can be redefined

### Example:
- list of activities with an analisys of each step
- roles involveds and itil practices
- it is a story
- mindset of continual improvement

## Processes

> Is a set of interrrelated activities that transform inputs into outputs. Define sequence of activities and dependencies.

A well-defined proccess can improve productivity.

Questions to succesfully create, deliver and improve a service
1. what is the generic delivery model for the service, and how does it work?
2. what is the value stream?
3. who performs?

External factors impose constraints and high degrees of volatility.
- **P**: Political
- **E**: Economical
- **S**: Social
- **T**: Technological
- **L**: Legal
- **E**: Environmental

# Takeaways
- Dimensions: 
    1. Organizations and people
    2. Information Technology
        - includes information and knowledge necessary for the management of services and the technologies required
    3. Partners and Suppliers
        - encompassess (abrange) relationships between organizations involved in the design, development, deployment, delivery, support and continuam improvement of services
    4. Value Streams and processess
- Services are affected by many external factors, that exhibit high degrees of volatility and uncertainty, and impose constraints how they work. (**PESTLE**)
