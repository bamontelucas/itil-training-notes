# Components
- Guiding principles: guide an organization in all circumstances. Should not be changed;
- Governance: beans the org is directed and controlled
- Service Value chain: is a set of interconnected activities that an organization performs to deliver a valueable product
- Practices: set of organizational resources designer for performing work. "Incident Management" is an example of practice
- Continual improvement: recurrent org activity performed at all levels

# Siloed organizations

    Organizational silos are a challenge to organizations

- Occur when:
    - resistance to change
    - difficulty in accessing information and specialized expertise
    - reduced efficiency that increases both cost and risk
    - difficulty in communication or collaboration

- Siloed organizations:
    - cannot act quickly to take advantage of opportunities
    - unable to make effective decisions about changes
    - can cause organization practices to become siloes

# The SVS

- orgs should be able to define and redefine value streams in a flexble, yet safe and efficient way
- guiding principles
    - guide overall improvement of the org
    - create a foundation for shared culture across org (that discourages siloes)
- svs supports many work approaches (lean, agile, etc.) with a flexible value-oriented operating model    

# Governance

    Is a system where organization is directed and controlled

- Evaluate
    - the governing body evaluates the org regularly as stakeholder's needs and external circumstances evolve
- Direct
    - the governing body assigns responsibilities, directs the preparation and implementation of organizational strategy and policies
- Monitor
    - the governing body monitors the performance of the organization and its practices, products and services

The government body needs to make sure that:
- SVC and practices work in line with direction given
- maintain oversight of the SVS
- both gov body and management at all levels maintain alignment through a clear set of shared principles and objectives
- the governance and management at all levels are continuallly improved to meet expectations of the stakeholders

# Key takeaways
- SVS includes SVC activities supported by org's universal and holistic practices
- the guiding principles help orgs adopt and adapt itil
- governance is realized through activities such as evaluate, direct and monitor
