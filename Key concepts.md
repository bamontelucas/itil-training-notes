# key concepts of service management

## Service Management

    Service management is a set of specialized organizational capatilities that enable value to customers in the form of services

## value

o propósito da organização é criar valor para os stakeholders

    value is defined as the perceived benefitis, usefullness, and importance of something

- o valor percebido é subjetivo, pelos usuários
- uni direcional
    - a relação entre o provedor e o consumidor de serviços é visto como uni-direcional
    - o consumidor não cria valor pra ele
- value co-creation
    - value is co-created through and active collaboration between providers and consumers

## stakeholders

    - pessoa ou grupo de pessoas com suas próprias funções/objetivos
    - podem ter outros papeis dependendo do ponto de vista
        - pode ser provider ou consumer dependendo da situação
- provedores de serviço

    - IT department of a company (other departments are the consumers)
        - apenas um exemplo
- consumidores de serviço
    - sub roles (can be different people, but can be combined). Importante identificar os papeis para uma boa comunicação e gestão
        - customer
            - defines the requirements of a service
            - takes responsibility for the outcome of service consumption

## value for stakeholder
values are different depending the stakeholder
- **serivce consumers:** benefits and optimized costs and risks
- **service provider:** funding from the consumer, business development, and image improvement

    - sense of purpose > longer life
- **society and community:** employment, taxes, contribution to development of the community
- **charity organizations:** financial and no financial contributions from other organizations
- **shareholders:** financial benefits (dividends; sense of assurance/stability)

## products and services
- product is a configuration of an organization's resources designed to offer value to consumers
    - complex and not entirely visible to the consumer
    - tailored to suit their consumer groups
- serices co-creates value by facilitation outcomes that customers want to achieve without having to manage specific costs and risks

# Value: outcomes, costs and risks

    Outcomes require resources, that require costs, that are associated with risks

- service relationships are perceived as valuable only when they have more positive effects
    - negative effects
        - affected outcomes
        - costs introduced
        - risks introduced/imposed
    - positive effects
        - supported outcomes
        - costs removed
        - risks removed

## outputs and outcomes

    - Output is a tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity
    - Outcome is a result for a stakelholder enabled by one or more outputs

## Costs

    Cost is the amound of money spent on a specific activity or resource.

- can be expressed in non-monetary terms, such as time spend, people allocated, etc
- it can be
    - Costs removed from the consumer by the service
    - Costs imposed on the consumer by the service
- important to understand both types to ensure that the correct decisions are made regarding the service relationship

## Risks

    Risk is a possible event that could harm or loss, or make it more difficult to achieve objectives

> It can be used in the context of measuring the probability of positive outcomes as well as negative outcomes

### types of risks
- risks removed/reducted from a consumer by the service
    - ex:
        - failure of the consumer's server hardware
        - lack of staff availability
- risks imposed on a consumer by the service
    - ex:
        - service provider ceasing to trade
        - experiencing a security breach

### Managing Risks

> A service provider should manage the detailed level of risk on behalf of the consumer

The consumer contributes to the reduction of risk through:
- actively partitipatinf in the definition of requirements of the service and clarification of required outcomes
- clearly communcating the success factors
- one more

## Utility and Warranty

- Utility
    - is the functionality offered by a product or service
    - determines if "fit for purpose"
- Warranty
    - how the service performs
    - determines if "fit for use"

Não adianta o serviço existir e funcionar se ele não está disponível/usável. Neste caso, o valor esperado não será atendido
