# 6.1k Incident Management
    The practice of minimizing the negative impact of incidents by restoring the service

# 6.2 Incident
    An unplanned interruption to a service or reduction of quality

> incidents are prioritized based on an agreed **classification** to ensure that the incidents with the highest impact are resolved first

usually there are separate processes for managing **major incidents** and **information security incidents**.

modern ITSM tools can provide **automated matching** of incidents to other incidents, problems, or known errors, and can even provide intelligent analysis of data to generate recommendations for helping with future incidents

> Some incidents will be solved by the user themselves using self-help

Some will be resolved by the service desk. Routing is typically based on the incident category, which helps identify the correct eam
 
**Swarming:** used for major incidents. Stakeholders from many teams get together (swarm) until it becomes clear which team is best to continue working on the incident

In extreme cases, **disaster recovery plans** may be invoked to resolve an incident

There should be a formam process for logging and managing incident. This procces **DOES NOT usually include detailed procedures for how to diagnose, investigate and resolve incidents**, but can provide techniques for making the investigation and diagnosis more efficient.

*Investigation of more complicated incidents often requires knowledge and expertise, rather tan procedural steps.*

# Problem Management
    
- trend analysis of incident records
- detection of duplicate and recurring issues
- identify the risk of an incident
- analyze info from partners and suppliers and internal team

## Problem Control
- prioritize problems based on risks 
- analyze from the 4 dimensions
- document workarounds
- after analysis, review workaround (and improve it)
- a workaround may become permanent way

## Error Control (manage known errors)
- find ways to fix problems
- identify potential permanent solutions (can trigger change request)
- changes must be justified in terms of costs, risks, and benefits
- regularly re-assess known errors

## Interfaces
- incident management
- risk management
- change enablement
- knowledge management
- continual improvement
