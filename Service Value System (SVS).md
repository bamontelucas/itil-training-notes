    Opportunitiy/demand > Service value chain > Value

- need to be able to respond
- need flexibility to react different ways
- designed to enable flexibility and discourage siloed working

> SVS describes how all the components and activities of the organization work together as a system to enable value creation

- each svs interfaces with other organizations 
- the components, activities and resources can be configured in multiple combinations
- requires coordination of activities and practices of all parties to be truly effective

---

**Opportunitiy/demand:** represent the possibilities of adding value to stakeholders or improving the organization

---

**Value:** is the outcome of the SVS.

---

Opportunity/demands triggers activities within the SVS that lead to value creation

# Components
- Guiding principles: guide an organization in all circumstances. Should not be changed;
- Governance: beans the org is directed and controlled
- Service Value chain: is a set of interconnected activities that an organization performs to deliver a valueable product
- Practices: set of organizational resources designer for performing work. "Incident Management" is an example of practice
- Continual improvement: recurrent org activity performed at all levels

# Siloed organizations

    Organizational silos are a challenge to organizations

- Occur when:
    - resistance to change
    - difficulty in accessing information and specialized expertise
    - reduced efficiency that increases both cost and risk
    - difficulty in communication or collaboration

- Siloed organizations:
    - cannot act quickly to take advantage of opportunities
    - unable to make effective decisions about changes
    - can cause organization practices to become siloes

# The SVS

- orgs should be able to define and redefine value streams in a flexble, yet safe and efficient way
- guiding principles
    - guide overall improvement of the org
    - create a foundation for shared culture across org (that discourages siloes)
- svs supports many work approaches (lean, agile, etc.) with a flexible value-oriented operating model    

# The ITIL Guiding Principles

> A guiding principle is a recomendation that guides an organization in ***all circumstances***

- universal and enduring
- help orgs adopt and adapt ITIL guidance to their specific needs
- help to integrate multiple methods (lean, agile, devops, etc.) into an overall approach to service management
- unversally applicable to all initiatives
- encourage and support continual improvement at all levels

## 1. Focus on value

> The organization should create value for itself, customers, and other stakeholders

1. Identify the **service consumer** (and key stakeholders)
2. Know the consumer's perspective of value
    - what is important?
    - why is important?
    - how he uses?
    - risks involved
    - costs involved
3. Map value to the intended outcomes that change over time
    - defined by consumer needs
    - changes over time
4. Know the customer experience (CX) or the user experienc (UX)
    - CX: entirety of the interactions
        - how does it "feel"

Applying:
1. Know how consumers use each service
2. Encourage a focus on value among all staff
3. Focus on value during operational activities and improvement initiatives
4. Focus on the value in every step of the improvement initiative

## 2. Start where you are

> Before starting an improvement initiative, consider what is already available to be leveraged. Do not start over.

- Decisions should be based on accurate information obtained through direct observation and appropriate measurement
- Obtaining data from the source avoids assumptions that can have a negative impact on the budget and timeline
    - (D)ata > (I)nformation > (K)nowledge > (W)isdom

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

### Role of Measurement

- Measurement should be used to support the analysis of what has been observed
- A Service desk that focuses on time taken to resolve incidents shall mainly focus on minimizing the negative impact to the customer instead of just resolving.
- Metrics should be meaningful and related to the desired outcome

### Applying

1. Look
    - look at what already exists
2. Determine
    - determine if successfull practices or services can be replicated
3. Apply
    - apply risk management skills in the decision-making process
4. Recognize
    - recognize that sometimes nothing from the current state can be reused

## 3. Progress Iteratively with Feedback

    Organize work into small, manageable sections to execute them in a timely manner

- can be sequential or simultaneos
    - depending of resources or nature
- individual iterations should be managed
    - ensure output
- the need of an iteration may be altered or even eliminated
- seeking feedback before, during, and after each iteration will ensure that actions are focused and appropriate

> Feedback loop is a situation where part of the output is used for a new input

Well constructured feedback mechanisms facilitate understanding of the:
- end user and customer perception of the value
- efficienty and effectiveness of value chain activities
- effectiveness of service governance and management controls
- interfaces between the org and its partner and supplier network
- demand for products and services

> Working in a timeboxed, iterative manner with feedback loops ensures greater flexibility, faster responses, and an overall improvement in quality.

### Applying

- Understand the big picture but ensure steady progress
    - don't analyze too much without doing anything
- Receive feedback at all times for a constantly changing ecosystem
- Use minimum viable product
    - then get feedback to improve (new iteration)

## 4. Collaborate and Promote Visibility

> Right people in the right role ensures more buy-in, more relevance and increased likelihood of long-term success

- Agile, lean, and other itsm frameworks will not work without effective collaboration
- It is important to identify and manage all stakeholder groups

Stakeholder includes:
- devs working with other internal teams
- suppliers collaboratin with the org
- relationship managers collaborating with service consumers
- customers collaborating with each other
- internal and external suppliers collaborating with each other

Poor visibility of work affects decision-making and impacts the organization's ability to improve internal capabilities

1. understand the flow of work in progress
2. identify bottlenecks and excess capacity
3. uncover waste (then back to 1)

### Applying

- Collaboration does not mean consensus
    - it is not necessary (and maybe not even good) to reach and agreement
- Communicate in a way the audience can hear
    - what is the right method?
    - what is the right message?    
- Decisions can only be made on visible data
    - less risk than just be deciding over assumptions/feeling
    - balance between cost of collecting data and benefit from it

## 5. Think and Work Holistically

    A holistic approach to service management requires an understanding of how all the parts of an organization work together

It requires an end-to-end visibility of how demand is captured and translated into outcomes

### Applying

1. Recognize the complexity of the systems
2. Remember that collaboration is key to thinking and workking holistically
3. Look for patterns in the needs and interactions between system elements
4. Remember that automation can facilitate working holistically

## 6. Keep It Simple and Practical

> Outcome-based thinking should be used to produce practical solutions that deliver valuable outcomes

- Use the minimum number of steps to accomplish an objective
- Ensure that actions contribute to value creation
- Start with uncomplicated approach and then add controls, activities, or metrics when needed
- Be mindful of competing objectives

### Applying

1. Every action should create value
2. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
3. Do fewer things, but to them better
4. Respect the time of the people involved
5. Simple practices are easier to understand and follow
6. Quick wins allow organizations to demonstrate progress and manage stakeholder expectations
